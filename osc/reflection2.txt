Operation Systems Concepts: Reflection 2

1. I learned what a PCB and footprint was. I knew how processes were ran and that
 
	they were allocated space in RAM, but I learned the actual structure and 

	how the information is packed inside the PCB & footprint

2.The cycle of a process was really helpful in understanding how the processor 
	runs every running process in a cycle. It makes sense
 that it can't run
	things at the same time unless it has multiple
	cores, so this lifecycle
	of a process is a great explanation for
	how everything gets done so quickly.

3. Protecting address space- the two ways the processor does this is with the
 & limit 
	registers and checks, and relocatable addresses. This helped 
me understand
	how information is protected from being written over
and also taken by other 
	processes without permission in RAM

4. Synchronization or processes is a very important concept that all 
processors obey
	to some degree. It helps organize all the processes and avoid them stepping 
	over each others toes;
	they all work together and share necessary data, 
	and don't run ahead if another process needs to be ran first. They're

	all very nice to each other

5. Going back a little bit - I have used different operating systems
 and understood 
	(in an abracted way) how they worked. Getting
 to know them on a deeper level
	is really interesting. Seeing
 everything come together, concepts I'm
	familiar with get a 
deeper meaning and attach themselves to underlying
	principles
 which make sense when explained, but were never necessary to 

	understand to use and know my way around an operating system. 
I'm excited
	to see where this class goes in terms of what other
 dots can be connected 
	for me to deeply understand operating systems.
 Dr. Sastry is doing a great 
	job so far engaging the class and it's 
definitely my most looked-forward 
	to class of the week.
