Project 4: Tower of Hanoi
----------------------------

In this assignment, you will implement tower of hanoi by using learned static stack and algorithms.


## Getting started

Investigate the contents of files. You should
have the following files:

- `CMakeLists.txt` --- The build system for your homework. Read this file
   carefully.
- `mystack.h` --- The definition of your static class template 
   and its associated functions will go here. You need to finish all functions 
   that required for the project.
- `towers.cpp` and `towers.h` --- The definition of your tower of hanoi class
   and its associated functions will go here. You need to finish all functions 
   that required for the project.
- `towerofhanoi.cpp` --- main() function goes into this file. It starts the tower and
   run the tower. You don't need to modify this file.
- `results.txt` --- The result after your program runs.
   Your output must match this file

Make a directory called towerofhanoi, and move all above files into the directory.
You can try building the project, but it won't work.

## project requirements

1. Some instruction details are provided in files, you must read these instructions 
   before writing your code.
2. You must finish all functions that classes require. 
3. Your results must match to the results provided
