Computer Networks Project Proposal
Online Multiplayer .io game

Our project idea is to create an online website where people can log in with a name, and instantly be put into an online game-arena to compete against other players. A generic leaderboard would always be in view to show currently online player names with the most points, as an incentive for the player to keep playing. 

We were planning on using the pixi.js library for our HTML5 canvas game programming, and node.js along with WebSockets for the networking side of it. 

Ispiration for this idea comes from websites like agar.io and airma.sh

After initial research, the netorking side of a project like this would be the most tricky, especially when involving WebSockets.
