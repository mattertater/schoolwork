Chapter 1, Problem 2
"Describe the relationship between the problem identification, research, and requirements specification phases of the design process"
All of these steps in the design process are closely related, and are not necesarily steps to be followed in order. After requirements are found for a solution to a problem, some rething and more research may need to be done to more effectively solve the problem. The initial problem must be well defined enough to have a clear solution to be researched
